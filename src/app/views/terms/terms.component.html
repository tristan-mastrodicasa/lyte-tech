        <h2 class="mb-3">Lyte Tech Terms of Trade</h2>
	<p><strong>Lyte Tech Terms of Trade</strong></p><p>0.1: Please find below the standard Lyte Tech Limited Terms and Conditions of trade. In engaging Lyte Tech Limited you accept the Terms and Conditions contained in this document. </p><p>0.2: These standard Terms and Conditions apply to all web development and related work undertaken by Lyte Tech, in addition, and subject to any other specific terms and conditions agreed between Lyte Tech Limited ("<strong>Lyte Tech</strong>", "<strong>LT</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>" and "<strong>us</strong>") and its clients ("<strong>you</strong>", "<strong>Client</strong>"). Such other terms and conditions, if any, in conjunction with these standard Terms and Conditions are referred to as the "<strong>Agreement</strong>". They are intended to set out the rights and obligations for each party. Any specific agreements between you and us, as part of the Agreement, will take precedence over these Standard Terms and Conditions.  However, where no specific agreement exists in the Agreement, these Standard Terms and Conditions will apply. </p><p>0.3: Other definitions used in this document are listed below (in alphabetical order):</p><ul><li>"<strong>Acceptance</strong><span>" the moment when the Client has accepted the work (some may call this </span><em>signed off</em><span> on the work) constitutes acceptance of the terms contained in the Agreement.</span></li>
<li>"<strong>Additional Services</strong><span>" means any additional services outside of the scope of the Project Brief.</span></li>
<li>"<strong>Change Request</strong><span>" refers to any material deviation from the Project Brief.</span></li>

<li>"<strong>Lyte Tech Materials</strong><span>" means any designs, design materials, software, routines, know-how, methodologies, user-interface conventions or design patterns, interfaces to third-party products and other development and design tools (and all enhancements and derivatives thereto) which Lyte Tech (i) developed prior to this agreement or (ii) develops during the course of this agreement but which are developed either at Lyte Techâ€™s cost or which are not uniquely applicable to the particular specifications, characteristics or functions of the Deliverables.</span></li>
<li>"<strong>Website</strong><span>" means any web, intranet, mobile application, web application, extranet, or other software development or application work carried out by Lyte Tech.</span></li>
</ul><p>0.4: Lyte Tech uses open source code to develop bespoke software for its Clients. For this work, Lyte Tech endeavours to provide to its Clients:</p><ul><li>a. an accurate account of the hours we spend on Projects, as invoiced, and/or provide a promised Website functionality for a quoted price; and</li>
<li>b. best coding practice, to the best of our abilities.</li>
</ul><p>0.5 We explicitly do not make any guarantees that:</p><ul><li>a. our recommendations or implementations will work as you may envisage,</li>
<li>b. our software and coding will be error free, and</li>
<li>c. we will deliver on time.</li>
</ul><p>0.6: Furthermore, it is important to note that all software provided by Lyte Tech Ltd. is provided "as is" and it will not carry any expressed or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. In no event shall Lyte Tech Ltd be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.</p><p>0.7: Due to the experimental and rapidly evolving nature of software development, we have no option but to transfer the risks of software development back to our Clients. Our goal is to reduce the risks by both Parties engaging in honest, clear and regular communication.</p><h2>1. Project steps</h2><p>1.1: Before the Agreement is made about services to be provided by LT for the benefit of the Client, we shall communicate with you in a variety of ways (quotes, meetings, emails, etc...) to determine what you require. The sum of these communications is called the Project Brief. Unless advised otherwise, we will not charge you for the development of this Project Brief. Upon agreement of the Project Brief, Lyte Tech will commence work to develop the Website (Commencement Date). This is also the commencement of the Agreement.</p><p>1.2: For larger projects, the Project may be broken down into several smaller ones. In this case, each smaller project can be referred to as a Project and each will go through the steps set out in clause 1.</p><p>1.3: You will provide us with any Client Materials as specified in the Project Brief. Any services required to convert or input Client Materials not set forth in the Project Brief shall be charged as Additional Services.</p><p>1.4: We may use combinations of technology, as we deem appropriate, to develop the Website.</p><p>1.5: If you wish to depart from the Project Brief by making a Change Request then our standard times and materials apply. Alternatively, if requested by the Client, the Parties will, in good faith, agree to additional fees to cover those revisions (charged as Additional Services). The Client has the responsibility to ensure no Change Requests are made without ascertaining their potential costs.</p><p>1.6: The Client will have 90 calendar days, or such other time as Lyte Tech and the Client agree in writing, from the date of Going Live to review and request in writing from us revisions to the Website Development. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to implement such revision requests that are within the scope of, and consistent with the Project Brief.</p><p>1.7: If the Client has not made any requests for revisions by the end of 90 calendar days from the Project Going Live then the Deliverables shall be deemed to be accepted by The Client ("<strong>Acceptance</strong>") and any improvements or changes will require a new agreement. </p><p>1.8: The full outstanding amount for the Project shall be paid for before Going Live.</p><h2>2. Website development</h2><p>2.1: You have read and understood the way we develop websites and our policies in relation to this work.</p><p>2.2: You understand that no web development is perfect, that bugs and errors are the rule rather than the exception and that the world wide web is a fast changing medium where technology is constantly outdated.</p><p>2.3: You are aware that Lyte Tech will use a wide range of Open Source software in your Website and you need to be aware of how Open Source works.</p><h2>3. intellectual property rights</h2><p>3.1: The Client Materials you provide to us to carry out our obligations under the Agreement are owned by you. You grant us a licence to modify, reproduce, create derivative works from, and otherwise use such Intellectual Property to provide services or products in connection with the Project Brief.</p><p>3.2: All materials including, but not limited to any computer software code, script, programming code, data, information or web-related script developed or provided by us under this Agreement, and any trade secrets, know-how, methodologies and processes related to our products or services, shall remain our sole and exclusive intellectual property, including, without limitation, all copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and/or any other proprietary rights inherent in the Lyte Tech materials.</p><p>3.3: Lyte Tech will not accept liability for:</p><ul><li><span data-mce-mark="1">any claim of infringement based on the use of a outdated or altered release of Deliverables if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of a up-to-date or unaltered release of the Deliverables, which we have provided to you; </span></li>
<li><span data-mce-mark="1">the unauthorised modification of the Deliverables; or </span></li>
<li><span data-mce-mark="1">the use of the Deliverables in any manner other than those recommended by Lyte Tech.</span></li>
</ul><p>3.4: You acknowledge and agree that Lyte Tech is the sole and exclusive owner of all Intellectual Property in and relating to the Deliverables and that you have no rights in or relating to the Deliverables other than are expressly provided for in the Agreement.</p><p>3.5: The provisions of this Clause 3 shall survive the expiry or termination of the Agreement.</p><h2>4. Licences</h2><p>4.1: We grant, and you accept from us, an exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual licence to use the Deliverables created by Lyte Tech for use as, or incorporation into, a website or other software application, as agreed in the Project Brief. Any portrayal or use of the Deliverables that does not take place on a platform that is operated by you for your own business purposes shall be in breach of this Clause 4.1.</p><p>4.2: In consideration of the licence to use the Client Materials and Lyte Tech materials in the Deliverables you agree to pay Lyte Tech the fees specified in the Project Brief and/or the Agreement.</p><p>4.3: You acknowledge that any licence granted by us under this Clause 4 is granted subject to third party licencors (if any).</p><p>4.4: The exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual licence only applies to the Client Materials as a whole. Lyte Tech has the right to use parts of the Lyte Tech Materials for other projects as it sees fit, as long as it does not do so in a demonstrable competition with the intentions of the Project Brief. As a matter of explanatory guidance, the following analogy is used: if Lyte Tech wrote a book for you (the Deliverable) then you have the exclusive, perpetual rights to the format and full sequence of words in the book only (i. e., you can sell the book as you see fit as long as it is in the provided format). In contrast, you do not have any (exclusive or otherwise) rights to any of the individual words, sentences of paragraphs in the book, nor individual formatting elements, even if any of those were invented specifically in the process of writing your book (for which you paid Lyte Tech).<span data-mce-mark="1"> </span></p><h2>5. Our obligations</h2><p>5.1: We make the following warranties to you in respect to the products and services provided under this agreement:</p><ul><li>a. we have the right to grant the licences in respect of the Deliverables under this agreement to you without violating any rights of any third party;</li>
<li>b. the Deliverables will, in all substantial respects, conform with the Project Brief, or as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties;</li>
<li>c. we will use reasonable means to ensure the Deliverables do not contain any known virus or computer software code, routines or devices (other than as provided for in the Project Brief) designed to disable, damage or impair the Deliverables, or other software or data; and</li>
<li>d. we will fix any errors, bugs, or other oversights free of charge within a period of 90 days from the moment of "Acceptance", but only if these errors prevent the Website from working as intended in the Project Brief.</li>
</ul><p>5.2: Our representation in Clause 5.1 will not apply where you have used the Deliverables in a manner or for a purpose not discussed in the Project Brief or not authorised by us, or where you have made any adaptations, extensions or modifications to the Deliverables.</p><p>5.3: The client's sole remedy in the event of a representation in Clause 5.1 being breached, at our option, is replacement of the defective Deliverables or refund of the licence fee paid for the Deliverables.</p><h2>6. Your obligations</h2><p>6.1: You acknowledge that we do not transfer any ownership rights of the Deliverables, and you acknowledge that we reserve the rights not expressly granted.</p><p>6.2: You are responsible for the use, administration, and management of the Website.</p><p>6.3: You acknowledge that we are in the business of web development and that we shall have the right to provide third party services which are the same or similar to the services we provide to you and to use or otherwise exploit any Lyte Tech materials in providing such services.</p><p>6.4: You agree that the Deliverables comprising of a Website are not warranted to operate on computer systems and networks which do not meet any minimum specifications set out in the Project Brief or common industry standards.</p><p>6.5: You confirm that to the best of your knowledge you own, or are validly licensed to provide under the Agreement, all copyright and all other Intellectual Property rights in your Client Materials and our use of your Client Materials will not infringe the Intellectual Property or other rights of any third party or breach any applicable law, statute or regulation.</p><p>6.6: You agree to indemnify us against all losses, costs, expenses, demands, or liabilities (including all legal costs and expenses) incurred by us relating to any claim that the provision of your Client Materials, or the use of your Client Materials by us, infringes on the Intellectual Property rights of any third party or any breach of your obligations under this agreement or any wilful, unlawful or negligent act or omission by you.</p><p>6.7: You shall ensure that the Client Materials do not contain obscene, threatening or malicious content and that they do not infringe any law, or third party right or which may otherwise expose us to civil or criminal liability. Provision of any Client Materials, which do not satisfy this clause, shall be deemed to be a material breach of the Agreement. Lyte Tech also reserves the right to terminate the Agreement on the basis of perceived negative social or environmental consequences that may arise from the use of the Deliverables (e.g. we will not assist in the development of pornographic or fraudulent websites).</p><p>6.8: Any provision of maintenance and support which is not covered in the Project Brief shall be paid for by you as additional (Additional Services).</p><h2>7. Disclaimer and limitation of liability</h2><p>7.1: We disclaim all warranties and conditions, whether express, implied or statutory, other than those identified expressly in this agreement, including but not limited to warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. We will not be liable for any services or products provided by third party vendors, developers or consultants referred to you by us unless such third party products or services are provided under written agreement between you and us, and then only to the extent expressly provided in those agreements.</p><p>7.2: Under no circumstances (including, but not limited to negligence) shall we, or our officers, employees, partners, agents or suppliers, be liable for:</p><ul><li>your reliance on the Deliverables; or</li>
<li>any direct, incidental, special, consequential, indirect or punitive damages (including loss of use, loss of data, loss of profits, loss of anticipated savings, or loss of goodwill) that result from the use of, or the inability to use, or relating to the Deliverables.</li>
</ul><p>7.3: If you are using the Deliverables for the purposes of business, then you agree that the provisions of the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 shall not apply to you.</p><p>7.4: You agree that the total liability of LT, our officers, employees, agents, partners or suppliers (together) to you or anyone else using the products or services we provide to you (together) or damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, tort, including negligence, under statute or otherwise) shall not exceed the total cost of providing the Deliverables or $10,000 NZD whichever is the lesser amount.</p><h2>8. Resolution of disputes</h2><p>8.1: The parties will use their best endeavours to amicably resolve any dispute between them, which may arise concerning the interpretation of the Agreement or in relation to any matter arising under the Agreement. If the parties cannot settle amicably and in good faith any dispute between them then the party with the claim may submit the dispute to the Disputes Tribunal.</p><p>8.2: For the avoidance of doubt, the existence of a dispute will not relieve any party from the requirement to perform its obligations under the Agreement generally, and notwithstanding the dispute, each party will continue to perform such obligations in accordance with the Agreement to the maximum extent possible (while having regard to the nature of the dispute).</p><h2>9. Breach and termination</h2><p>9.1: Either party may terminate the Agreement by providing 30 calendar days prior written notice to the other party at any time.</p><p>9.2: If either party breaches any term of the Agreement, then the other party shall give notice to the offending party in writing to remedy the breach. If the breach is not remedied within 14 days then either party may, at their discretion, terminate the Agreement.</p><p>9.3: If you commit an act of bankruptcy, or, where you are a company, if a receiver is appointed or you do anything which would render you liable to be liquidated we may terminate this Agreement immediately upon providing written notice to you.</p><h2>10. Effect of termination</h2><p>10.1: If the Agreement is terminated by either party then the following will apply:</p><ul><li>a. any licence granted under or pursuant to the Agreement will end and you will not be authorized to use the Deliverables after expiry or termination of the Agreement;</li>
<li>b. you agree to pay us for any work carried out up to the date of termination;</li>
<li>c. you agree to pay us for any unpaid fees arising from your use of the Deliverables up to the date of termination;</li>
<li>d. you agree to return to us, on our demand, any manuals, specifications, designs or other information relating to the business of Lyte Tech, or the services or products provided under this agreement;</li>
<li>e. termination of the Agreement shall be without prejudice to the rights of any party which have accrued prior to, or which arise in connection with, such termination; and</li>
<li>f. the provisions of the Agreement intended to apply after termination shall continue to apply.</li>
</ul><h2>11. General provisions</h2><p>11.1: Notices to you may be given by email or by regular mail.</p><p>11.2: We will not be liable for any failure to perform the Agreement if it is due to a cause beyond our reasonable control.</p><p>11.3: The provisions of the Agreement shall not be varied, except by agreement in writing, including email, between the Parties.</p><p>11.4: The Parties agree that New Zealand law governs the Agreement and that New Zealand courts have jurisdiction.</p><p>11.5: Lyte Tech reserves the right to update these Terms and Conditions at any time without the need to inform the Client. Whatever Terms and Conditions were in place at the Commencement date are the ones applicable to the Project, but only if the Parties exchanged a copy to agree on the Terms and Conditions of engagement at the Commencement date. In all other cases, the most recent Terms and Conditions apply.</p><h2>12. Interpretation</h2><p>12.1: In this agreement, unless the context otherwise requires:</p><ul><li>a. the singular includes the plural and vice versa; and</li>
<li>b. references to a part, section or clause is a reference to that part, section or clause in this agreement, unless specifically stated otherwise.</li>
</ul><p>12.3: To the extent that there is any inconsistency or conflict between the client specific Agreement and these Terms and Conditions, the more Client specific part of the Agreement will take precedent.</p><h1>SPECIAL TOPICS</h1><p>To follow are some more specific Terms and Conditions that provide clarity to specific situations.</p><h2>13. Quotes</h2><p>13.1: In many cases, Lyte Tech will provide a quote as part of the Agreement of a Project and invoice the Client for the agreed price in the quote. In all cases where no quote is provided, Lyte Tech will work on an hourly rate (times and materials basis). This rate is NZD130.00+GST (goods and services tax, only applicable to New Zealand based businesses) per hour unless agreed otherwise (in many cases we can offer more competitive rates for longer-term projects). No matter what expectations, presumptions, or ideas the Client may have about the actual cost of a particular job, if no quote has been agreed on, clearly labelled by Lyte Tech as a quote, then the Client agrees to pay Lyte Tech for any agreed work carried out on a time and attendance basis.  </p><p>13.2: The quote may not be amended in any way without agreement from Lyte Tech. For example, a quote can only be accepted in its entirety and not in parts.</p><p>13.3 The Client will need to keep all quotes confidential.</p><h2>14. Hosting</h2><p>14.1: Every website needs a host (a place where it is stored and from where it can be accessed by users through the Internet). In most cases, Lyte Tech recommends hosting companies and liaises in the relationship between the hosting company and the Client. However, under no circumstances will Lyte Tech take responsibility for any problems that arise from actions of the actual hosting provider even if the Client pays Lyte Tech for the hosting. The reason for this are that:</p><ul><li>a. Lyte Tech pays the hosting fee to the actual hosting company on the Client's behalf, and</li>
<li>b. any surplus income from the hosting fee is solely used to pay for the transaction and liaising service provided by Lyte Tech. </li>
</ul><p>14.2: The Client is required to select a hosting company in agreement with Lyte Tech.</p><p>14.3: From time to time, Lyte Tech will carry out maintenance on the Client's hosting platform (e.g. apply security patches). This means that the Client's website may be <em>offline</em> during that time. What is more, some piece of code that worked at various periods of time, may stop working because of new server settings and security requirements. It is the sole responsibility of the Client to regularly check if the Website is still working as intended and to contact Lyte Tech immediately if there are any doubts about this. All websites will go down from time to time and the Client accepts this as business as usual.  Lyte Tech will take reasonable steps to minimise these down-times. </p><p>14.4: Lyte Tech reserves the right to disable the Client's hosting for the sole reason of hosting invoices not being paid by their due date. We highly recommend all our clients to set up an automatic payment for hosting to avoid such situations.</p><p>14.5: Only limited back-up facilities are provided for Lyte Tech hosted websites. In practice that means that the website can, in most cases, be <em>rolled back</em>, between one and a few days. That is, if all the content is deleted today then, in most instances, we may be able to recover the state of the website yesterday. If you want to be very sure about having proper back-ups then there is only one solution: make your own back-ups, store them on a separate device in a different place, and test the back-up and back-up systems regularly. Lyte Tech will not accept liability for any direct or indirect losses caused by back-up failure of any kind.</p><h2>15. Deliverables and timeline</h2><p>15.1: Lyte Tech shall contact via email or meet with the Client on a mutually acceptable schedule for progress reports, problems encountered, and recommended changes relating to the development and testing of the Website.</p><p>15.2: Lyte Tech will make every effort to meet deadlines or let the Client know as soon as possible if it is clear that these will not be met. However, failure to meet deadlines does not automatically mean that Lyte Tech has broken the Agreement. It is in the nature of software projects for there to be delays and they should be expected.</p><h2>16. The Client is responsible for uploading content</h2><p>16.1: Unless agreed otherwise, the Client is required to provide and insert all content on the Website, using Content Management Systems provided by Lyte Tech.</p><p>16.2: Working with a Content Management System requires a fair amount of computer literacy. For Clients who come to Lyte Tech with little or no web or computer knowledge Lyte Tech can also provide training but additional costs will be associated with this.</p><p>16.3: For content changes that cannot be achieved by the Client using the provided Content Management System, the Client may request Lyte Tech to make the changes. Lyte Tech reserves the right to charge its standard hourly rate for this work.</p><h2>17. who is at fault?</h2><p>17.1: Websites usually are made up of many layers of code (in most cases this will include code from Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP, and the Silverstripe CMS). In most cases Lyte Tech only applies the top layer, amalgamating thousands of lines of code written by others into a website. It will often be impossible for the Client to determine where a problem lies (a mistake made by Lyte Tech or a fault in the underlying code) and so it will have to rely on advice from Lyte Tech or invite a third-party to determine the cause of a problem. Lyte Tech will communicate about these matters with the Client in an open manner and Lyte Tech welcomes any questions towards finding the underlying causes of bugs and errors.</p><h2>18. Testing</h2><p>18.1: While Lyte Tech will take reasonable steps to ensure that any Deliverables are free from faults, there is a significant chance there will be some errors (bugs) in the Deliverables. Lyte Tech does not employ a tester as a matter of course. Unless specified otherwise, the Client will be required to carry out and be fully responsible for all testing. This means that the Client will need to set aside some time and resources to make sure the Website is working according to the Project Brief. Alternatively, Lyte Tech can provide testing services to the Client, both in terms of technical functionality and user experience. These services shall be considered as Additional Charges, unless contracted otherwise.</p><h2>19. Browser compatibility</h2><p>19.1: The website shall function to industry standards on the latest versions of the most popular browsers, the latest version(s) of</p><ul><li>Chrome</li>
<li>Firefox,</li>
<li>Internet Explorer, and</li>
</ul><p>19.2: If the Client requires the Deliverables to function on any other platforms or browsers (e.g. iPhone 5s, iPad 4, or a specific Nokia phone) then this must be specifically requested and documented in the Project Brief. These are Additional Services and additional charges will apply.</p><p>19.3: We specifically exclude all outdated versions of Internet Explorer (the ones that have been replaced with a newer version) from the collection of modern browsers, because they are outdated and often incompatible with current technology. Support for these browsers can be provided at an hourly rate.</p><p>19.4: Websites can be viewed in many different ways: on a computer monitor, a mobile phone, a TV screen, as a printout, on an i-pod, and so on. Unless agreed otherwise, Lyte Tech will only ensure that the Clientâ€™s Website will work on the most common monitors (e.g. 1024 pixels).</p><p>19.5: We do promise that your Website will work on any other browser versions or configurations other than the ones listed in Clause 19. However, your Website may also work on other viewing devices and browser versions, because Lyte Tech aims to develop its code following best practice in web standards. </p><h2>20. Payment, fees and licensing</h2><p>20.1: Unless agreed otherwise, half of the quoted cost for each Project (part) is due before the Project starts. The remaining amount is invoiced at completion of the same Project.</p><p>21.2: Lyte Tech reserves the right to request progress payments at any time during a Project, up to, but not exceeding all work carried up to that time. </p><p>20.3: Lyte Tech invoices are due within 21 days of invoice date unless agreed otherwise.</p><p>20.4: Billable expenses (e.g. purchase of a Font for the Client, premium module, PDF converters) are invoiced at the time they are incurred.</p><p>20.4: Every invoice paid after its due date will incur a NZ$25 administration fee and 2% of the original invoice in interest and service fees, per month overdue. For example, if an invoice is three months overdue, the total late fees are: NZ$25 + 3 x 2% of [total invoice sum excluding GST]. If the total cost of an invoice, excluding GST, is $100 and the invoice is paid three months late then the total late payment fees and penalties are: $25 + 2 + 2 +2 = $31. Late payment penalties and administration costs are charged using additional invoices and these late payment invoices invoices can also attract late payment penalties in their own right.</p><p>20.5: The Client will be held responsible for all collection and legal fees that may be necessitated to collect payment of an invoice. </p><p>20.6: Lyte Tech reserves the right to remove the Clientâ€™s Website from public viewing until all invoices have been paid in full.</p><p>20.7: The Client is required to pay Lyte Tech in a manner that is acceptable to Lyte Tech. Lyte Tech reserves the right to charge for any payment transaction costs.</p><p>20.8: Any questions and disputes about invoice amounts need to be raised by the client before the due date of the invoice. All invoices are deemed to be accepted at their due date.</p><h2>21. Partnership</h2><p>21.1: Software is a cooperative effort rather than an individual achievement and, in this light, Lyte Tech will try to work with the Client to achieve the best results. The more the Client works in partnership with Lyte Tech, the more the Client will get out of their Website.</p><p>21.2: Lyte Tech is committed to helping the Client become more successful in whatever they do. Similarly, the Client will be expected to provide a supportive environment for Lyte Tech in which we can deliver our services in the most efficient, fun and effective manner.</p><p>21.3: An important part of effective partnership is clear and open communication. Both Parties are expected to communicate in good faith.</p><h2>22. Assignment of work</h2><p>22.1: Lyte Tech reserves the right to assign other designers or technical experts to the project to ensure quality and on-time completion. All contractors will be vetted by Lyte Tech for their suitability and reliability to carry out the work and Lyte Tech will take responsibility for their actions, as far as this is required under New Zealand law, while performing the contracted work.</p><h2>23. Confidentiality and open source code</h2><p>23.1: Lyte Tech acknowledges and agrees that sensitive source material, technical and marketing plans, and other sensitive business information provided by the Client and developed in the course of a project are confidential information, unless agreed otherwise. Lyte Tech will take all practicable steps to maintain this confidentiality. As a rule of thumb, basic coding solutions are not considered to be confidential (see Clause 23.2). Similarly, the Client will treat as confidential to Lyte Tech pricing, trade secrets, working methods, coding plans, and any other information; whether or not dissemination could aid Lyte Tech competitors or whether or not dissemination may reduce Lyte Techâ€™s income potential. </p><p>23.2: While confidentiality is important, Lyte Tech is also a supporter of Open Source Software Development. Many of the Lyte Tech clients have benefited from this approach. Therefore, at our discretion, Lyte Tech may publish non-sensitive, generic parts of any Project as Open Source Code. This mainly happens, where, for example, the code can be used for a wide variety of uses not relating to the Project at hand, or in situations where peer review and peer contribution could aid the future development of the code. Lyte Tech reserves the right to publish parts of the Project as Open Source Code without seeking permission from the Client.</p><p>23.3: Because Lyte Tech promotes the use and development of open source software, our general rule of thumb is that generic code developed in the course of a project should be placed in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to do so. Clients will benefit substantially from previous open source releases and so, in the same spirit,  Lyte Tech expects all their Clients to provide some level of support to open source software development. </p><p>23.4: Many people new to Open Source concepts fear that it may have a negative impact on their business. They may be reassured to learn that the Internet is an excellent example of Open Source effectiveness: almost everything that makes up the Internet (Linux, Apache, Javascript, MySql, PHP, CSS, HTML, etc.) is Open Source or at least freely visible and easy to copy. Open Source Publication can aid in bug-fixing, improving compatibility with other software, upgrade-ability, security improvements, promotion and marketing, as well as continuing development of a Website. For example, the Apple operating system is based on Linux which is completely free and open source; the Google Chrome browser is almost completely open source, and the Android mobile phone operating system is open source.  </p><h2>24. conflict of interest</h2><p>24.1: Where possible, Lyte Tech will avoid working for two clients who are in direct competition. In grey areas, we will endeavour to discuss any conflict of interests with all parties involved. Similarly, you must disclose any relationships that may cause a conflict of interest from your side (e.g. your business partner owns a web development company who compete with Lyte Tech).</p><h2>25. supportive communities</h2><p>25.1: Lyte Tech tries to deliver on an (informal) triple bottom line. This means that Lyte Tech measures its success based on economic, social and environmental impact.</p><p>25.2: Lyte Tech  reserves the right to cancel any Agreement for any project that it deems to be adversely affecting its triple bottom line. For example, Lyte Tech will not be involved in developing websites with deceitful content. Lyte Tech will notify the Client as soon as they become aware it deems the Clientâ€™s Project unacceptable under this policy. Lyte Tech will try to help the client find a suitable, alternative service provider.  </p>
